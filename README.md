### 1.1 Dataset
Outdoor soybean images can be downloaded here [P2PNet-Soy](https://github.com/UTokyo-FieldPhenomics-Lab/P2PNet-Soy?tab=readme-ov-file).    
Some other images used in this study that not taken by us can be downloaded here [YOLO-Pod](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-Ouj8fFG_owOnJtDDGBQ29_gDyCUdu93).    

The soybean images and annotation files in our paper can be downloaded here [Normal dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PmQALeJxR7hxE7UHhgGxQfSc0xXBSHec/view?usp=drive_link), [Domain adaptation dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PmQALeJxR7hxE7UHhgGxQfSc0xXBSHec/view?usp=drive_link).    

You may need to place the images from other studies into the downloaded dataset's right image folder (corresponding to the annotation files in the training and evaluation sets).    
Corresponding annotation files can be find in this repository (yolo_soybean/datasets).
